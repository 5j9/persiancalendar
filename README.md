This is a partial port of Calendrical Calculations code to Python, focused on the astronomical Persian calendar.

The code is updated to reflect the best information available on
the ground about the Persian calendar, especially changing its locale
to 52.5 degrees east, which is what Iranian calendar authorities use.
